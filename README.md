# Hi, I'm Hillel Ohayon 👋  
**Team Lead | Data Analyst | B.Sc. in Computer Science & Mathematics | M.Sc. in Data Science & AI (in progress)**

I’m a data analyst and team lead with a strong background in large-scale data systems, machine learning research, and operational analytics. I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Mathematics and am currently completing an M.Sc. in Data Science & AI (started October 2025).

Currently serving as a **Team Lead of Data Analysts and BI Experts** in the Israeli Intelligence Corps, I lead complex, mission-critical data initiatives that drive real-world impact. My strengths lie in problem-solving, modern data engineering tools, and building ML-driven solutions that turn complex data into actionable insights.
